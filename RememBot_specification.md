# Specification for"RememBot" - short for remember robot.

## AI and Embeddings Approach

RememBot does not use GPU acceleration, NVIDIA libraries, or local embedding models. All semantic search and AI features are performed via cloud APIs (OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc). Optionally, local models (Ollama, llamacpp) may be supported for background tasks, but are not required or enabled by default.

It will be a telegram bot that runs as a service on a linux desktop - it is behind a nat firewall so it may need to do long polling not webhook.



## RememBot Specification

### Overview

**RememBot** (Remember Robot) is a Telegram bot service running on a Linux desktop behind a NAT firewall. It relies on **long polling** due to network constraints. It enables users to share any content (URLs, images, documents, text) through Telegram’s "Share" feature instead of saving or bookmarking inside individual platforms. RememBot ingests and archives this content intelligently for later querying.

### Architecture \& Deployment

- **Platform:** Linux desktop service (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- **Telegram communication:** Use Telegram Bot API via **long polling** to avoid public IP/SSL complications from firewall/NAT constraints[^1][^3][^5].
- **Service management:** Run as a **systemd service** for automatic start/stop and monitoring[^2].

Written in Python.  Astral UV modern package management ('uv run', 'uv add', 'project.toml'). 


### Core Functionalities

1. **Message Ingestion**
    - RememBot silently ingests any message or shared content sent to it.
    - No reply or acknowledgement message to user, just silent storage of data.
    - Supports multiple message types:
        - URLs
        - Images
        - Documents (PDF, Word, Excel)
        - Plain text
2. **Content Processing**
    - **URL ingestion:**
        - Fetch page content (preferably fallback to services like Tavily MCP Extract if blocked by captchas).
        - Extract article text, metadata, author, publication date if available.
    - **Image ingestion:**
        - Run local image recognition AI model (CPU mode OK, slow is acceptable)
        - Apply OCR to extract readable text when appropriate.
    - **Document ingestion:**
        - Parse metadata and content from popular document formats:
            - PDF
            - Word (.docx)
            - Excel (.xlsx)
3. **Data Storage**
    - Local **SQLite** database initially.
    - Schema includes:


| Field | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `id` | Unique item ID |
| `user_telegram_id` | Telegram user ID (to separate user data) |
| `original_share` | Raw input (URL, text, image binary ref) |
| `metadata` | Date, time, source platform (if detectable), content-type |
| `extracted_info` | Text content from URL, OCR text, document text |
| `taxonomy` | Classification tags generated by AI (Dewey Decimal, British Library, LOC scheme) |

    - Future-proof schema design for easy upgrade to scalable DB (e.g., PostgreSQL).
4. **Taxonomy \& Classification**
    - Use AI to assign classification tags aligned with library cataloging standards (Dewey Decimal, British Library, Library of Congress).
    - Enables better semantic search and organization.
5. **Querying \& Retrieval**
    - Users interact with RememBot via Telegram chat commands or buttons.
    - Basic queries supported:
        - "What was that tweet about X I read last week?"
        - "Summarize all articles about Y"
        - "What is the URL for that video I saved about Z?"
    - Advanced analytics queries:
        - Sentiment analysis trends over time on mentioned topics.
        - Price prediction statistics aggregation from saved articles/tweets.
    - Query processing workflow:

6. User query converted into structured requests.
7. Query translated programmatically into SQL statements with AI assistance.
8. Results post-processed and summarized by AI (e.g., GPT) as needed.
9. Self-correcting logic: if no results, AI suggests broader queries or alternative SQL.
10. Transparent feedback to user if results are insufficient.
1. **Roadmap: Web Interface**
    - Future plan to create a web interface for:
        - More flexible querying and visualization.
        - Managing large datasets.
        - Viewing taxonomy and metadata visually.

### Technical Details

| Component | Technology / Tool |
| :-- | :-- |
| Telegram Bot | Python/grammY or python-telegram-bot with long polling |
| Content scraping | Custom fetch + Tavily MCP Extract fallback for captchas |
| Image Recognition | Local AI model (e.g., TensorFlow/PyTorch model in CPU mode) |
| OCR | Tesseract OCR or equivalent on local server |
| Document Parsing | python-docx, PyPDF2, openpyxl for Word, PDF, Excel |
| Database | SQLite (local, upgradeable) |
| AI Model for Taxonomy \& Queries | Integration with OpenAI GPT-4 or local LLM for SQL generation and summarization |
| System Service | systemd unit to keep bot running persistently |

### User Experience

- Users share any content to RememBot via Telegram's Share.
- No active replies cluttering the chat.
- Later, users send queries in natural language and receive concise answers or summaries.
- Bot handles multi-format inputs automatically and stores richly annotated entries.
- Privacy ensured by storing data locally, segregated by Telegram user ID.


### Summary

| Feature | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| Platform | Linux desktop, systemd service |
| Telegram update method | Long polling due to NAT/firewall |
| Input types supported | URLs, images, documents, text |
| Content extraction | Fetch/parse URLs, local AI-based image recognition \& OCR, document parsing |
| Storage | SQLite DB with user isolation |
| Semantic enrichment | AI-driven taxonomy tagging (library classification) |
| Query interface | Telegram bot commands with AI-driven SQL query formation |
| Future extension | Web UI for advanced queries and data management |

This specification balances ease of deployment, privacy, and extensibility, leveraging the Telegram platform’s broad "Share" feature and liberating users from fragmented bookmarking workflows. It supports rich content ingestion, semantic organization, and AI-powered query capabilities tailored to individual users.

If implemented carefully, RememBot can become a personal knowledge assistant bridging multiple media and platforms seamlessly.
